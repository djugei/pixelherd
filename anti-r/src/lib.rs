//! Anti-R contains a alternative spatial data structure that outperforms R-Trees in many cases.
//!
//! # Performance:
//! R-Trees and anti-r have the same O(n) complexity for all operations,
//! log(n) for searching and updating, n\*log(n) for creation.
//!
//! They only differ by constant factors,
//! either x or y in O(log\_b(n+x)+y)
//! and the base of the logarithm,
//! which is 2 for Anti-R and configurable for R-Tree, generally 3-6.
//!
//! Anti-R is always faster at updating all elements and bulk-loading by a constant factor,
//! therefore it is more noticeable for small n.
//!
//! Full updates and bulk-loads are equivalent in speed for Anti-R.
//! For R-Trees full updates are never worth it,
//! a full reconstruction is simply faster.
//!
//! Zero to a bit more than 100\_000 elements are faster to query for Anti-R.
//! R-Trees start winning at above 200\_000 elements.
//! This is probably when (on the benchmarking machine) L1-cache is overrun.
//!
//! R-Trees might be catching up quicker if the elements are weirdly distributed.
//!
//! See the bench directory and the output of cargo bench (target/criterion) for more details.
//!
//! Notice that this has been benched against the rstar crate,
//! which might not be the fastest implementation of an R-Tree in existence.
//! The benchmark results are exactly as expected though.

/// A slice that supports spatial queries.
///
/// The slice is basically just sorted by K.
/// If K is a position in space this means its sorted by its coordinates
/// which allows for spatial queries with logarithmic complexity.
///
/// If you want to modify elements just let this go out of scope, modify the base slice and rebuild
/// the SpatSlice, potentially using new_unchecked if you uphold ordering.
/// If you opt into the alloc feature you can also use [SpatVec].
///
/// The trait bound on the K for most of the functions is PartialOrd.
/// This is a lie.
/// If a comparison fails the function will panic.
/// Therefore the real trait bound would be Ord.
/// Its just insanely inconvenient to have to deal with that for floats
/// which are probably the mainly used data type for this.
